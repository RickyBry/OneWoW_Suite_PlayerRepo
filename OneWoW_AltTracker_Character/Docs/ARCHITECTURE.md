## What This Addon Does

This is a companion data collection addon for OneWoW AltTracker. It automatically collects:

- **Character Info** - Name, class, race, level, experience
- **Location Data** - Current zone and coordinates
- **Guild Information** - Guild name and rank
- **Equipment** - Currently equipped items and item levels
- **Currencies** - Gold, honor, conquest, and other currencies
- **Rest Status** - Whether character is rested

## How It Works

This addon runs silently in the background and automatically collects character data from each character when you log in. The main AltTracker addon reads this data to display a unified view of all your characters.

---

## Required Addon

This addon requires:
- **OneWoW_AltTracker** - The main AltTracker addon that reads this data
